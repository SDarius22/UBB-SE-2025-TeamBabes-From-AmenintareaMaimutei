## 🏥 Hospital Management System
Welcome to the **Amenintarea Maimutei** team repository! This project is developed as part of the **Software Engineering Course 2024-2025** at UBB, Group 927, Team #4. Our goal is to build a **Hospital Management Application** using **C# + .NET with WinUI** for the frontend.

## 📌 Project Overview
The part of the application we develop will enable **administrators** to manage hospital operations efficiently and allow **patients** to provide feedback on their experiences. The Hospital project as a whole follows a structured development process where our team will gradually merge smaller components from multiple teams into a fully functional system.
